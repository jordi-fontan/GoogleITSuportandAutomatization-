#### 1. Question 1

What are some examples of security goals that you may have for an organization? Check all that apply. 
1 / 1 point

- [x] To deploy an Intrusion Prevention System

- [ ] To prevent unauthorized access to customer credentials 
Correct 

Great job! These are super important goals. Safeguards or systems should be implemented to help achieve them. It's important to distinguish between a discrete goal and the mechanisms or defense systems that help you to achieve these goals. Defenses on their own aren't goals, but they allow us to work towards these goals.
